A basic game about only dashing that a beginner programmer is making on his free time.

I'm trying to make this game playable, but it's my first attempt, so don't be too hopeful

Stuff that I want to implement:
- Real enemies
- Menus
- A dash selecting thing like in tetris
- Different types of dashes like:
  - Direction limited movement
  - Weirdly shaped dashes
  - "Elemental" dashes
  - Differently sized dashes
  - And other diverse things.

they would be tied with different enemy mechanics like a water dash to dodge a fire attack, and would be combinable to get to stuff like short only right or strong curved dash.
